These are the design files for a G8000 Filter Network for old style PDP11 machines with DD11-A UniBus backplanes which have no +15V power supply in it. Please pay attention to the fact that you have to add some wires to your backplane if you want to use the G8000 board. Check the DEC documentation for your application.

The gerber files can be used to order these PCB's at a PCB supplier.

Regards, Roland
